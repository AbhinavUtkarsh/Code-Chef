# Strange Number 
Problem Code: STRNO
## [Problem Statement](https://www.codechef.com/APRIL20B/problems/STRNO) :

When Varsha was travelling home, she saw a mysterious villa. Varsha is curious about this strange villa and wants to explore it. When she reached the entry gate, the guard gave her a problem to solve and said that he would allow her to enter the villa only if she solved it.
The guard gave Varsha two integers X and K . Varsha needs to determine whether there is an integer A such that it has exactly X positive integer divisors and exactly K of them are prime numbers.

Varsha found this problem really hard to solve. Can you help her?

## Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers X and K.

## Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer: 1 if a valid integer A
exists or 0 if it does not exist.

### Constraints

1≤T≤103

1≤X,K≤10^9

### Example Input

1

4 2

### Example Output
1

Explanation
Example case 1: A=6 has X=4 factors: 1, 2, 3 and 6. It also has exactly K=2 prime factors: 2 and 3.
